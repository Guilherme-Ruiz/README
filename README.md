# README

Hello,

My name is Guilherme Ruiz, I am looking for a new change in my career, I come from the support area with experience in many other areas such as infrastructure, programming, and database. However, I never went deeper, so I am still in support.

But I want to make a change, and I am today 05/31/2020, setting a goal of at least 3 months, to master some programming language. I hope to have strength, dedication and a lot of focus.

"Persistence makes perfect"

I will use this phrase to reach "perfection" or close to it, since we know it is difficult, but not impossible.
